# Adapt
Adaptive job matching

<h1>The Problem:</h1>
<p>
	We are addressing the problem where people are graduating form <i>Generation</i>, but are not being matched with job providers properly.
</p>

<h1>The Solution:</h1>
<p>
	The solution is <i>Adapt</i>. <i>Adapt</i> records your skills, preferences and personality traits. It uses this to match Job Seekers with Job Providers who entered the same information as criteria for a job. Match filtering is then done in an interesting way...
	<br/>
	From here, we plan to add VR functionality to facilitate interviews. We also want to integrate facebook messenger to further connect Job Seekers and Job Providers.
